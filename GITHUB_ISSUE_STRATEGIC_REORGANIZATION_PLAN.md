## 🏗️ **STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
**Focus**: Issue reorganization and architectural design
**Agents**: All 5 agents working in parallel
**Goal**: Create organized foundation for long-term project

**Parallel Workstreams**:
1. **Issue Reorganization**: Agent 1 restructures GitHub issue
2. **Architecture Research**: Agent 2 researches and designs overall system
3. **Requirements Analysis**: Agent 3 breaks down into modules
4. **Test Strategy**: Agent 4 designs validation approach
5. **Process Design**: Agent 5 creates collaboration framework

### **Phase 2: Modular Implementation (Weeks 2-N)**
**Focus**: Sequential implementation of modules based on dependency analysis
**Agents**: Specialist agents for each module + coordination oversight
**Goal**: Implement and validate each module independently

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. **Module Planning**: Detailed design for specific module
2. **Implementation**: Code changes for module functionality
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive validation using GUI tests
4. **Integration**: Combine with previously completed modules
5. **Documentation**: Update GitHub issue with progress and results

### **Phase 3: System Integration (Final Week)**
**Focus**: End-to-end system validation and production readiness
**Agents**: Integration specialists + original architecture team
**Goal**: Prove complete FGD sync system works end-to-end
