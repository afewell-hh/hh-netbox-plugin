Hi, I have been working with another team to create a NetBox plugin that integrates with Hedgehog's Kubernetes-based Ethernet fabric solution. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to manage their custom resource definitions (CRDs) related to the Hedgehog fabric. The plugin will allow users to create, monitor, and inventory their CRDs through a web interface, leveraging NetBox's existing capabilities. 

The other team has already made significant progress, including creating a basic plugin structure and implementing the necessary API calls to interact with Hedgehog's Kubernetes cluster. They have also set up a dashboard to display the status of the CRDs and their synchronization with Kubernetes. Kubectl in the local environment is setup to so it can interact with a live hedgehog installation. Also, netbox-docker is installed and running, the previous dev team successfully created and installed the netbox plugin and got pretty far into its development, I am pretty happy with how things look so far, but the other team seemed to be getting stuck on being able to further progress the plugin development towards the desired UX and functionality, so I wanted to see if you can help bring this project to successful mvp, completing the features the other team was unable to complete. The other team created a variety of code, planning documents, documentation and other files that are all saved locally within this repo, so I think by studying those thoroughly, you should be able to get a good understanding of the current state of the project and what needs to be done next. Where we left off is the fabric detail page has buttons for "test connection" and "sync now" which the other team could not get to work, and there are a number of other features that are not yet implemented, such as the ability to create and manage the various CRDs through a web form interface.

In addition to all the files that are available locally, I wanted to share with you the original instructions I provided to the other team, which outline the overall goals and requirements for the NetBox plugin. These instructions should give you a clear understanding of what we are trying to achieve with this project:

I think it would be a good idea for you to thoroughly research the best practices for netbox plugin development before you get started.

Hi, I work for Hedgehog and we make an ethernet fabric solution that essentially uses kubernetes to manage physical ethernet switches. To configure the fabric, a user creates a variety of yaml objects for custom CRD's that are created by hedgehog. The hedgehog controllers then use the information provided in these cr's to create configuration files for ethernet switches. The customer does not need to be aware of the ethernet switches directly, the switches themselves, all the connections, all the objects that make up the physical fabric, they are all monitored in kubernetes and use kubernetes reconciliation to report metrics and object availability. And so customers only need to interact with kubernetes to configure and monitor their fabric. 

I need to create a simpler way for our customers to create, monitor, and have an inventory of the cr's they have applied to kubernetes for their hedgehog fabric. I think for each type of object, it would be cool to have a gui similar to a self service catalog where a customer could click a button to add a type of cr, and then be presented with a web form, and then be given the option to apply the configuration, and then be able to have an inventory of the cr's that have been applied in k8s for their fabric. A customer might have more than one fabric. And, it would be ideal if this system could sync with kubernetes and was able to display status on if the object is applied, if its live, if there are errors. We already have grafana dashboards so that wouldnt need to be comprehensive, but I think it would be helpful if customers could look at the objects that represent desired state and easily be able to tell if actual state was aligned with desired state from looking at their inventory of applied CR's. 

I think it would be ideal to do this as a netbox plugin. I dont know how extensible netbox is so we need to do some research and concept validation, but if it can support the type of UX I would like to have I think it would be ideal, many of our customers already use netbox, and it would be nice to not have to give them yet another tool to manage. 

I would like you to help me scope this out, validate the concept, and then create specifications and a plan to implement it. 

The hedgehog CR's that should be included in the initial scope are:
**VPC API CRDs:**
* External
* ExternalAttachment
* ExternalPeering
* IPv4Namespace
* VPC
* VPCAttachment
* VPCPeering

**Wiring API CRDs:**
* Connection
* Server
* Switch
* SwitchGroup
* VLANNamespace
