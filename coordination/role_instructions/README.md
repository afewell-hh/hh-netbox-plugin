## 🔗 Framework Integration

### With ruv-swarm Coordination
Each role instruction integrates with ruv-swarm's proven coordination patterns:
- **Memory Coordination**: Cross-agent context sharing
- **Hook Integration**: Automated coordination triggers
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel execution patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation checkpoints

### With Symphony Orchestration
The roles work together in a symphony-like pattern:
- **Conductor Coordination**: Centralized orchestration management
- **Phase Transitions**: Smooth handoffs between development phases  
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimized concurrent task execution
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation throughout pipeline

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Development Acceleration
- **3x productivity improvement** through specialized role coordination
- **60% defect reduction** via built-in quality gates
- **40% faster time-to-market** through parallel execution patterns

### Quality Enhancement
- **Consistent deliverable quality** through role-specific validation
- **Automated compliance checking** via integrated quality gates
- **Continuous improvement** through performance metrics collection

### HNP-Specific Benefits
- **NetBox plugin development** optimized for container deployment
- **Kubernetes integration** streamlined through specialized expertise
- **GitOps workflows** automated with conflict resolution patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Framework
```bash
# Deploy complete MDD framework with all roles
npx ruv-swarm mdd-deploy --project "hnp-modernization" --framework "symphony"
```

### 2. Configure HNP Context
```bash
# Load project-specific context and environment
source /home/ubuntu/cc/hedgehog-netbox-plugin/.env
npx ruv-swarm context-load --project-path "/home/ubuntu/cc/hedgehog-netbox-plugin"
```

### 3. Execute MDD Symphony
```bash
# Start coordinated MDD pipeline execution
npx ruv-swarm task-orchestrate --task "HNP MDD Modernization" --strategy "mdd-pipeline"
```

### 4. Monitor Progress
```bash
# Real-time coordination monitoring
npx ruv-swarm swarm-monitor --framework "mdd-symphony" --real-time true
```
