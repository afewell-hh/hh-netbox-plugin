Error analysis for drift detection page:

1. Initial error: TemplateDoesNotExist: netbox_hedgehog/drift_detection_simple.html
   - Fixed by updating view template_name to use the correct template

2. Current error: NoReverseMatch: 'netbox_hedgehog' is not a registered namespace
   - This suggests there's URL reversal happening somewhere
   - Not in the template (verified by using standalone HTML)  
   - Not in the view context (verified by minimal context)
   - Likely in some other part of the system

3. Testing results:
   - Other plugin URLs work fine (fabrics/, etc.)
   - Simple TemplateView works with other templates
   - Issue is specific to DriftDetectionDashboardView

4. Next steps:
   - Check for imports that might cause URL resolution
   - Check if there's any middleware or signal processing
   - Create a completely new view class to isolate the issue
