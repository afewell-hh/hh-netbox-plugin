"""
End-to-End (E2E) Tests for Hedgehog NetBox Plugin

These tests use Playwright to test actual browser behavior, including:
- Client-side JavaScript execution
- CSS rendering
- Navigation highlighting
- Full user interaction flows

E2E tests are slower than integration tests but provide complete coverage
of frontend behavior that cannot be tested with Django's test client.
