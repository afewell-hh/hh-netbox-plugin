"""
Browser-based UX tests for NetBox Hedgehog Plugin.

These tests use Playwright to validate the actual user experience in a browser,
ensuring that users can successfully interact with the UI, not just that the
backend code works.

Tests run headless on the host machine and connect to NetBox at http://localhost:8000.
