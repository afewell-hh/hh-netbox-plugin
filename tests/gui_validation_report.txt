=== MICRO-SCOPE GUI VALIDATION REPORT ===
Task: gui-validate-1
Timestamp: 2025-08-12 20:14:00 UTC
Time Limit: 15 minutes
Scope: Test sync button presence ONLY in GUI

=== FINDINGS ===

1. SERVICE AVAILABILITY:
   - Target URL: http://localhost:8000/plugins/hedgehog/fabrics/35/
   - Status: SERVICE UNAVAILABLE (Connection refused)
   - NetBox container: STARTING (was exited, restarted during test)
   - Container health: Starting (not yet healthy)

2. CONTAINER STATUS:
   - NetBox main container: netbox-docker-netbox-1
   - Previous state: Exited (1) 
   - Current state: Up (health: starting)
   - Port mapping: 0.0.0.0:8000->8080/tcp

3. SERVICE DISCOVERY:
   - Port 8000: CLOSED (target port)
   - Port 8080: OPEN (Python HTTP server - unrelated)
   - No Django/NetBox processes running on host

4. SYNC BUTTON TEST RESULT:
   ❌ UNABLE TO COMPLETE
   - Reason: NetBox service not accessible
   - Container startup issues preventing page load
   - Authentication test not possible

=== STARTUP ISSUES IDENTIFIED ===

From container logs:
- Database connection delays ("Waiting on DB...")
- Config loading attempts with plugins.py
- Possible database constraint violations (historical context)

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

For next validation attempt:
1. Ensure database is fully ready before NetBox starts
2. Check for migration issues (Django index name errors mentioned in context)
3. Allow 2-3 minutes for full container startup
4. Verify fabric ID 35 exists in database
5. Test authentication with admin/admin credentials

=== VALIDATION STATUS ===
INCOMPLETE - Service startup issues prevented GUI testing
Sync button presence/absence: UNKNOWN
Page loading: FAILED (connection refused)
Error messages: NOT ACCESSIBLE
Browser console errors: NOT TESTABLE

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Fix container startup issues
2. Retry validation once service is stable
3. Complete sync button element detection
4. Document any authentication requirements
