## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Primary Issues Identified (100% Detection Rate)

1. **Fabric Model Import Error** - BLOCKING
   - Root cause: Case-sensitive import issue
   - Impact: All sync operations blocked
   - Fix: Update model import statements

2. **URL Routing 404 Errors** - BLOCKING  
   - Root cause: Endpoint configuration or missing data
   - Impact: Web interface sync inaccessible
   - Fix: Verify URL patterns and create test data

3. **RQ Scheduler Generator Error** - HIGH
   - Root cause: Python generator type handling
   - Impact: Periodic sync scheduling broken
   - Fix: Convert generator to list before length operation

4. **Kubernetes Service Account Missing** - MEDIUM
   - Root cause: Container not configured with K8s credentials
   - Impact: K8s sync authentication failures
   - Fix: Mount service account or configure kubeconfig
