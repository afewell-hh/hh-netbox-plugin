## Quick Start Guide

1. **New to the project?** Start with `00_current_state/project_overview.md`
2. **Looking for current work?** Check `00_current_state/active_sprints.md`
3. **Planning new work?** Use templates in `99_templates/`
4. **Need historical context?** Browse `04_history/`

## Navigation Tips

- Each subdirectory contains its own README.md with detailed guidance
- Use the numbered prefixes to understand the workflow progression
- Current/active information is always in lower-numbered directories
- Historical/reference information is in higher-numbered directories

## Maintenance

This structure follows the CLAUDE.md architecture for optimal agent navigation. Key maintenance tasks:
- Daily updates to `00_current_state/`
- Sprint boundary updates to planning and execution directories
- Regular archival of completed work to `04_history/`
- Template updates based on usage feedback
