# Agent Coordination Directory

**Purpose**: Facilitate communication, coordination, and escalation between agents working on the HNP project.

## Key Documents

- **agent_assignments.md** - Current roles and responsibilities matrix
- **inter_agent_comm.md** - Communication logs and coordination notes
- **escalation_tracking.md** - Issue escalations and resolution status
- **orchestrator_logs.md** - High-level orchestrator decisions and delegation

## Subdirectories

### manager_reports/
- **template.md** - Standard report format
- **current/** - Active period reports from managers

## Coordination Patterns

### Orchestrator-Worker Model
1. **Orchestrator** analyzes complex tasks
2. **Managers** handle feature-level coordination
3. **Specialists** implement specific technical tasks

### Communication Flow
- All coordination through orchestrator
- Structured handoffs between agents
- External memory for context sharing
- Clear escalation pathways

## Update Schedule

- **Daily**: Agent communication logs
- **Weekly**: Manager reports
- **As needed**: Escalation tracking
- **Per task**: Assignment updates

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Handoffs**: Document context when transferring work
2. **Escalate Early**: Don't wait when blocked
3. **Use Templates**: Maintain consistency in reports
4. **Track Decisions**: Log important coordination decisions
