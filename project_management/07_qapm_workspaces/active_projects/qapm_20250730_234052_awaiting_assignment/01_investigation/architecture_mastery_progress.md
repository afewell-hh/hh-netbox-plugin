### Critical Navigation Rules Internalized ✅

**Rule 1: NEVER Skip Architecture Review**
- Always review relevant architecture documentation before technical work ✅
- Understand consequences of violations (regressions, scatter, lost decisions) ✅

**Rule 2: ALWAYS Use Centralized Documentation**
- Never create architectural documentation outside `/architecture_specifications/` ✅
- Never rely on scattered or outdated specifications ✅

**Rule 3: Follow Cross-Reference System**
- Use @references to navigate between related specifications ✅  
- Maintain awareness of cross-component implications ✅

## Level 2: Architectural Decision Understanding ✅

### ADR Process Mastery
**Understanding Architectural Decisions**:
- **Definition Mastered**: Documents significant design choices affecting system structure ✅
- **Critical Distinction**: Architectural decision vs. implementation detail ✅

**ADR Documentation Structure**:
- **Location Memorized**: `/architecture_specifications/01_architectural_decisions/` ✅
- **Structure Understanding**: decision_log.md → active_decisions/ → approved_decisions/ ✅
- **Format Knowledge**: Status, Date, Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences ✅

### ADR Review Process Mastered ✅
**Step 1: Pre-Work ADR Review**
- Navigate to decision_log.md ✅
- Identify relevant ADRs ✅
- Review decision context ✅
- Check implementation status ✅
- Identify constraints ✅

**Step 2: Decision Impact Assessment**
- Alignment with existing decisions ✅
- Need for modifications or extensions ✅
- Conflict identification ✅
- New ADR requirements ✅

### Current ADR Knowledge ✅
**9 ADRs Total (8 implemented, 1 approved)**:
- ADR-001: GitOps-First Architecture (Implemented) ✅

- ADR-008: Container-Based Development Environment (Implemented) ✅
- ADR-009: Evidence-Based Quality Assurance (Implemented) ✅

## Level 3: Change Impact Assessment ✅

### Systematic Change Assessment Process
**Before Making Changes**:
1. Review current architecture documentation ✅
2. Assess potential impacts on related components ✅
3. Document architectural implications ✅
4. Coordinate changes with architectural requirements ✅

### Architecture-First Mindset Adopted
- Never make changes without architectural context ✅
- Always consider cross-component implications ✅
- Document architectural implications appropriately ✅
- Escalate architectural uncertainties immediately ✅

## Level 4: Documentation Compliance ✅

### Centralized Documentation Principle Mastered
**FUNDAMENTAL RULE**: ALL architectural documentation in `/architecture_specifications/` ✅

**Forbidden Practices Understood**:
- ❌ Creating architectural docs in project root
- ❌ Adding specs to implementation directories
- ❌ Scattered documentation across locations
- ❌ Informal documentation in code comments only

**Required Practices Adopted**:
- ✅ Update centralized specifications after changes
- ✅ Maintain cross-references between related docs
- ✅ Follow established documentation structure
- ✅ Integrate documentation updates with code changes

### Documentation Update Process Mastered ✅
**Step 1: Pre-Change Documentation Review**
- Identify current documentation ✅
- Review documentation currency ✅
- Plan documentation updates ✅
- Check cross-references ✅
- Prepare update strategy ✅

**Step 2: Change Implementation with Documentation**
- Code changes with architectural requirements ✅
- Documentation updates in parallel ✅
- Cross-reference maintenance ✅
- Currency verification ✅
- Structure compliance ✅

**Step 3: Post-Change Documentation Validation**
- Documentation completeness verification ✅
- Cross-reference accuracy confirmation ✅
- Navigation verification from CLAUDE.md ✅
- Quality integration in completion evidence ✅
