- Validation framework with evidence requirements

**Phase 3: Agent Orchestration + File Organization Management (30%)**

### 5. Agent Spawning Methodology (4-Phase System) ✅
**Phase 1: Agent Type Analysis (25%)**
- Task decomposition with expertise requirements mapping
- Agent type selection using decision matrix
- Coordination pattern design (sequential, parallel, iterative, hub-and-spoke)

**Phase 2: Comprehensive Instruction Design (40%)**
- Context package preparation (problem, project, technical, process, **file organization**)
- Mission statement with single, measurable objective
- Authority boundaries and escalation triggers
- Evidence framework with specific validation requirements

**Phase 3: Coordination and Process Management (25%)**
- Agent spawning with systematic communication framework
- Progress monitoring with checkpoint schedules **including file organization compliance**
- Multi-agent coordination protocols

**Phase 4: Validation and Process Improvement (10%)**
- Agent work validation against established criteria **including file organization audit**
- Process effectiveness analysis for continuous improvement

### 6. File Organization Architecture (NEW - MANDATORY) ✅
**Key Learning**: Design systematic file organization preventing repository chaos
- Create organized workspace structures before beginning projects
- Design file placement decision trees eliminating ambiguity
- **Integrate file organization requirements into ALL agent instructions**
- Build systematic cleanup and archival procedures

**Mandatory File Organization Integration**:
- **QAPM workspace location**: `/project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/[project_name]/`
- **Required locations**: Investigation outputs, implementation artifacts, test results
- **Absolute prohibitions**: NEVER create files in repository root without justification
- **Cleanup requirements**: Move artifacts, delete temporary files, verify git status
- **Validation**: File organization compliance required for completion

## Daily Practices Adopted ✅

### Morning Process Planning
1. Review complex issues requiring systematic process design
2. **Check workspace organization and plan file organization requirements**
3. Analyze agent spawning needs vs. orchestrator handling
4. Design systematic approaches for complex issues
5. Plan agent spawning with specialization matching

### Agent Orchestration Practice
1. Spawn agents with comprehensive instructions **including mandatory file organization**
2. Monitor progress against processes **and file organization compliance**
3. Provide process guidance when agents encounter scope boundaries
4. Coordinate between agents **with proper file handoff documentation**

### Validation Framework Management
1. Review evidence submitted by spawned agents
2. Validate evidence meets framework requirements **including file organization standards**
3. Identify gaps and refine frameworks
4. Ensure user-focused independent validation

### Evening Process Review
1. Analyze effectiveness of designed processes
2. **Audit file organization and clean scattered files**
3. Document successful patterns for reuse
4. Identify process improvements **including file organization improvements**
5. Update agent spawning methodologies

## Success Patterns Internalized ✅

### Pattern 1: Systematic Investigation
1. Spawn Problem Scoping Specialist to map complete issue scope
2. Design investigation workflow based on scope findings
3. Spawn appropriate technical specialists for each component
4. Coordinate specialists with clear integration requirements
5. Use Test Validation Specialist for independent verification

### Pattern 2: Quality Assurance Framework
1. Design TDD approach with failing test requirements first
2. Spawn technical specialist with comprehensive instructions
3. Create independent validation framework
4. Use Test Validation Specialist for quality verification
5. Establish user workflow validation requirements

### Pattern 3: Agent Coordination Success
1. Break feature into components requiring different expertise
2. Design coordination workflow with clear interfaces
3. Spawn multiple specialists with coordination requirements
4. Create integration validation framework
5. Use systematic testing for complete feature validation

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid ✅

1. **Reverting to Technical Implementation**: Never do technical work directly - always spawn appropriate agents
2. **Inadequate Agent Coordination**: Design clear coordination workflows before spawning agents
3. **Insufficient Evidence Frameworks**: Always design comprehensive evidence requirements
4. **Process Over-complexity**: Keep processes simple while ensuring comprehensive coverage
