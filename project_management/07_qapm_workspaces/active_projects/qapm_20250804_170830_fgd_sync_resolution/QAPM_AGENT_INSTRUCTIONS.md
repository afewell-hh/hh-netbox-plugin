## CRITICAL MISSION CONTEXT

**Primary Assignment**: Resolve the critical FGD (Fabric GitOps Directory) sync process issues using Enhanced QAPM v2.5 methodology with memory-aware coordination.

**Historical Context**: Previous QAPM attempts failed due to memory limitations causing:
- 100% false completion rate when agents reported success without meeting basic test criteria
- Failure loops where QAPMs repeatedly spawned similar failing sub-agents
- Memory-induced performance degradation from auto-compacting events
- Sub-agents overwhelmed by overly complex tasks exceeding memory capacity

**Enhanced Methodology Available**: You have access to Enhanced QAPM v2.5 with Memory-Aware Coordination specifically designed to prevent these systematic failures.
