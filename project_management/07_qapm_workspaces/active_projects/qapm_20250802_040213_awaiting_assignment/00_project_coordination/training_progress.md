# QAPM Training Progress

**Agent ID**: qapm_20250802_040213_awaiting_assignment  
**Started**: 2025-08-02  
**Status**: Level 0 Universal Foundation - In Progress

## Level 0: Universal Foundation Analysis

### Environment Verification Results

✅ **Kubernetes Cluster**: HCKC cluster accessible - control-1 node ready  
❌ **Docker/NetBox**: Permission denied accessing Docker daemon  
❌ **Python Testing**: pytest module not found with python3  
⚠️ **Git Status**: Working directory has numerous untracked files and modifications

### Critical File Organization Issues Identified

**Repository Root Pollution**: Extensive untracked files in repository root violating foundation principles:
- Multiple .md report files scattered in root
- Python validation scripts in root  
- Various temporary/working files not in proper workspace locations
- Evidence of previous agents not following file organization protocols

**Git Working Directory**: Not clean - multiple modified files and numerous untracked files

### Key Learning Points from Universal Foundation

1. **Project Mission**: Self-service Kubernetes CRD management via NetBox interface
2. **Current Status**: MVP Complete - 12 CRD types operational
3. **File Organization Mandate**: NEVER create files in repository root without explicit justification
4. **QAPM Role**: Process architect, not technical implementer
5. **Escalation Required**: Environment issues detected requiring orchestrator guidance

### Environment Recovery Needed

Based on Universal Foundation guidelines, the following environment issues require escalation:
- Docker daemon access permissions  
- Python testing framework missing
- Extensive file organization violations

## Level 1: QAPM Track Mastery - COMPLETED

### Key Learning Points from QAPM Track

1. **Role Definition**: Process architect who designs systematic approaches, not technical implementer
2. **Core Responsibilities**: 
   - Systematic problem analysis with agent orchestration
   - Evidence-based validation framework design  
   - Quality process design with file organization integration
3. **Four-Phase Systematic Methodology**:
   - Phase 1: Problem Systematization + Workspace Setup
   - Phase 2: Process Architecture Design + Organization Framework
   - Phase 3: Agent Orchestration + File Organization Management  
   - Phase 4: Quality Validation + Organization Audit
4. **Agent Spawning Methodology**: Systematic approach to identify, spawn, and coordinate task-specific agents
5. **File Organization Integration**: Mandatory inclusion of file organization requirements in ALL agent instructions

## Level 2: Architecture Mastery - COMPLETED

### Key Learning Points from Architecture Mastery

1. **Architecture Navigation**: Mastered navigation from `/architecture_specifications/CLAUDE.md` to specific technical details
2. **ADR Understanding**: Learned architectural decision record process and decision analysis
3. **Documentation Compliance**: Understood ZERO TOLERANCE for documentation scatter
4. **Centralized Documentation**: Confirmed operational centralized documentation system with:
   - System overview and component architecture
   - Complete ADR documentation (9 decisions: 8 implemented, 1 approved)
   - GitOps architecture with comprehensive design
   - Proper cross-reference system with @reference patterns

### Current Status: Level 3 File Management Mastery - In Progress

### Next Steps

1. Complete Architecture Mastery training
2. Complete File Management Mastery and workspace protocols
3. Escalate environment issues to orchestrator
4. Prepare comprehensive file organization cleanup plan
5. Complete competency validations
