**Validation Status**: ✅ **ELIMINATED**
**Evidence**:
- No escalation triggers or coordination requirements present
- Content encourages direct technical investigation and resolution

**Validation Status**: ✅ **ELIMINATED**
**Evidence**:
- Performance context focuses on code and system optimization
- No agent coordination or meta-optimization requirements
- Technical performance constraints clearly defined

### Additional Pattern Verification

**Validation Status**: ✅ **ELIMINATED**
**Evidence**: Content universally applicable across all technical agent types

#### Pattern 12: Inappropriate Authority Boundary Assumptions
**Validation Status**: ✅ **ELIMINATED**
**Evidence**: Technical scope maintained within appropriate domain boundaries
