```
/project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/qapm_20250731_153550_awaiting_assignment/
├── 00_project_coordination/        # Agent management and project tracking
├── 01_investigation/              # Research and analysis coordination
├── 02_implementation/             # Development work coordination through specialists
├── 03_validation/                 # Quality assurance and independent validation
├── 04_sub_agent_work/            # Individual agent workspaces and coordination
├── 05_temporary_files/           # Session artifacts (automatically cleaned)
├── 06_project_archive/           # Completed work preservation
```

### File Organization Decision Tree (Memorized)
1. **Temporary/Working file?** → Use QAPM workspace temp/ directory (gitignored)
2. **Test artifact?** → Use /tests/ directory structure
3. **Project documentation?** → Use centralized /project_management/ or /architecture_specifications/
4. **Essential configuration?** → Repository root (with explicit justification ONLY)

### Mandatory File Organization Instructions Template
```markdown
FILE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
WORKSPACE LOCATION: /project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/[project_name]/

REQUIRED FILE LOCATIONS:
- Investigation outputs → [workspace]/01_problem_analysis/
- Implementation artifacts → [workspace]/04_evidence_collection/implementation_evidence/
- Test results → [workspace]/04_evidence_collection/test_results/
- Debug scripts → [workspace]/temp/debug_scripts/ (temporary)
- Working files → [workspace]/temp/working_files/ (temporary)

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- NEVER create files in repository root without explicit justification
- NEVER scatter files outside designated workspace
- NEVER leave temporary files uncommitted to git

CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS:
- Move all artifacts to proper workspace locations before completion
- Delete temporary files or move to gitignored temp/ directory
- Run `git status` to verify no unintended files created
- Document all file locations in completion report
```

## Evidence-Based Validation Framework Mastery

### Evidence Hierarchy (4 Levels)
1. **Technical Implementation Evidence**: Code changes, test results, error resolution
2. **Functional Validation Evidence**: Screenshots, workflow completion, API testing
3. **Quality Assurance Evidence**: Test suite execution, new tests, performance validation
4. **User Experience Evidence**: Real user workflows, authentication testing, edge cases

### Quality Standards (Evidence Requirements)
- Evidence must be objective and independently verifiable
- Screenshots must be annotated to clearly show relevant functionality
- Test results must include both positive and negative cases
- Documentation must be complete enough for independent validation

## Agent Instruction Template Mastery

**Complete Template Structure**:
```markdown
AGENT TYPE: [Specific specialist type]
MISSION: [Single, measurable objective]

PROBLEM CONTEXT: [Comprehensive background]
SYSTEMATIC PROCESS: [Step-by-step workflow]
AUTHORITY GRANTED: [Exactly what agent can do]
COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS: [Multi-agent integration]

FILE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS: [Mandatory workspace requirements]
EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS: [Specific proof needed]
ESCALATION TRIGGERS: [When to escalate to QAPM]
QUALITY VALIDATION: [Independent verification approach]

FILE ORGANIZATION VALIDATION: Work not complete until file organization verified.
```

## Success Patterns Internalized

### Pattern 1: The Systematic Investigation
1. Spawn Problem Scoping Specialist to map full issue scope
2. Design investigation workflow based on scope findings
3. Spawn appropriate technical specialists for each affected component
4. Coordinate specialists with clear integration requirements
5. Use Test Validation Specialist for independent verification

### Pattern 2: The Quality Assurance Framework
1. Design TDD approach with failing test requirements first
2. Spawn technical specialist with comprehensive instruction
3. Create independent validation framework
4. Use Test Validation Specialist for quality verification
5. Establish user workflow validation requirements

### Pattern 3: The Agent Coordination Success
1. Break feature into component parts requiring different expertise
2. Design coordination workflow with clear interfaces
3. Spawn multiple specialists with coordination requirements
4. Create integration validation framework
5. Use systematic testing approach to validate complete feature

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Identified)

1. **Reverting to Technical Implementation**: Must focus on process design, not hands-on work
2. **Inadequate Agent Coordination**: Must design clear coordination workflows
3. **Insufficient Evidence Frameworks**: Must create comprehensive validation requirements
4. **Process Over-complexity**: Keep processes simple while ensuring comprehensive coverage
