# QAPM Training Progress Log
**Agent ID**: qapm_20250731_153550_awaiting_assignment  
**Started**: July 31, 2025  
**Role**: Quality Assurance Project Manager (Process Architect)

## Environment Verification Results

### ✅ Working Systems
- HCKC Kubernetes cluster: Accessible (control-1 node ready)
- Git repository: Accessible (on flowtest branch)
- Project structure: Comprehensive and well-organized

### ⚠️ Environment Issues Found
- Docker daemon: Permission denied (netbox status unknown)
- Python/pytest: Not available directly (may need virtual environment or different Python path)

### Git Status Analysis
- Current branch: `flowtest` 
- Modified CSS files in progress
- Several untracked files including training-related documentation
- CLAUDE.md deleted but CLAUDE.old exists (suggests migration in progress)

## Universal Foundation Training - Level 0 Complete

### Key Learnings Internalized:
1. **Project Mission**: Self-service K8s CRD management via NetBox (MVP complete, 12 CRD types operational)
2. **Non-Negotiable Processes**: Git workflow, testing mandate, file organization, hierarchy awareness
3. **File Organization DNA**: Repository root only for essential config, use QAPM workspace structure
4. **QAPM Role**: Process architect who designs processes and coordinates specialists (NOT direct technical implementer)

### Critical Process Requirements Mastered:
- Feature branch → test → commit → PR workflow
- All code changes require passing tests
- Documentation updates with feature changes
- Proper escalation through hierarchy: Task agent → QAPM → Orchestrator
- **FILE ORGANIZATION**: Never create files in repository root without explicit justification

## QAPM Track Mastery Training - Complete

### Key Competencies Mastered:

#### Process Architecture vs. Technical Implementation
- **CRITICAL PARADIGM SHIFT**: QAPM role is process architect, NOT direct technical implementer
- Design systematic approaches and spawn appropriate specialists for execution
- Focus on orchestration, validation, and quality assurance through process design

#### Four-Phase Systematic Problem Approach
1. **Problem Systematization (25%)**: Map scope, define success criteria, establish evidence frameworks
2. **Process Architecture Design (35%)**: Agent type analysis, workflow design, coordination planning  
3. **Agent Orchestration Execution (30%)**: Spawning, monitoring, coordination management
4. **Quality Validation & Process Improvement (10%)**: Independent validation, process refinement

#### Agent Spawning Methodology
- **Agent Type Selection**: Problem Scoping → Technical Specialists → Architecture Review → Test Validation
- **Instruction Comprehensiveness**: Complete context, clear mission, authority boundaries, evidence requirements
- **Coordination Patterns**: Sequential, Parallel, Iterative, Hub-and-Spoke based on task requirements
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: Technical, Functional, Quality Assurance, User Experience evidence

#### File Organization Integration (NEW CRITICAL COMPETENCY)
- **Workspace Architecture**: All work must occur in organized QAPM workspace structure
- **Repository Protection**: NEVER create files in repository root without explicit justification
- **Agent Instructions**: ALL agent spawning must include mandatory file organization sections
- **Cleanup Protocols**: Temporary files management and workspace organization audit requirements

### Competency Validation:
✅ Process architect mindset over technical implementation focus  
✅ Systematic four-phase problem approach understanding  
✅ Agent type selection and coordination pattern design  
✅ Comprehensive instruction framework mastery  
✅ File organization integration into all agent workflows  

## Architecture Mastery Training - Complete

### Key Competencies Mastered:

#### Architecture Navigation Mastery (Level 1)
- **Entry Point Mastery**: Always start at `/architecture_specifications/CLAUDE.md`
- **Speed Navigation**: Navigate to any specification within 2 minutes using centralized structure
- **Cross-Reference System**: Follow @references between related specifications
- **Component Lookup**: Efficient access to current system architecture before changes

#### Architectural Decision Understanding (Level 2)
- **ADR Process Awareness**: Understand ADR documentation and decision lifecycle
- **Decision Research**: Navigate decision log and review relevant ADRs for context
- **Implementation Status**: Verify if decisions are approved/implemented
- **Decision Impact**: Understand architectural implications of existing decisions

#### Change Impact Assessment (Level 3)
- **Pre-Change Review**: Systematic architecture assessment before technical changes
- **Component Dependencies**: Map cross-component impacts and integration points
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential for regression or system issues
- **Coordination Requirements**: Identify architectural coordination needs

#### Documentation Compliance (Level 4)
- **CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: NEVER create scattered documentation outside `/architecture_specifications/`
- **Centralized Maintenance**: All architectural documentation in centralized structure
- **Cross-Reference Maintenance**: Keep @references current across specifications
- **Update Integration**: Documentation changes coordinated with code changes

### Architecture System Understanding:
✅ **Current System Status**: MVP Complete - 12 CRD types operational with 36 synchronized records  
✅ **GitOps Architecture**: Multi-fabric directory management with drift detection  
✅ **Authentication Design**: Encrypted credential storage with repository separation (approved)  
✅ **ADR Knowledge**: 9 ADRs total (8 implemented, 1 approved for implementation)  
✅ **Component Architecture**: NetBox plugin with Kubernetes integration patterns  

### Navigation Competency:
✅ Architecture entry point mastery (`/architecture_specifications/CLAUDE.md`)  
✅ System overview access for current architecture understanding  
✅ GitOps specifications for coordination requirements  
✅ ADR research for architectural decision context  
✅ Cross-reference following for related specifications  

### Compliance Competency:  
✅ **Documentation Scatter Prevention**: Never create docs outside centralized structure  
✅ **Centralized Documentation Maintenance**: All updates in proper locations  
✅ **Architecture Review Integration**: Pre-change architecture review mandatory  
✅ **Quality Gate Integration**: Architecture compliance in all completion evidence  

## Next Steps:
1. Demonstrate File Management Mastery competency using organized workspace
2. Create comprehensive training completion report demonstrating QAPM readiness
