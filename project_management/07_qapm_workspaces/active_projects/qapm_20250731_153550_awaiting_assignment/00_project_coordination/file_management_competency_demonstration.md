### 2. File Placement Decision Tree Mastery

**Decision Process Applied**:

1. **Temporary/Working file?** → `/05_temporary_files/` (gitignored) ✅
   - Training progress log placed in temporary files
   
2. **Project coordination file?** → `/00_project_coordination/` ✅
   - This competency demonstration file properly placed
   
3. **Investigation output?** → `/01_investigation/` ✅
   - Would place analysis results here
   
4. **Implementation artifact?** → `/02_implementation/` ✅
   - Would place code experiments and working scripts here
   
5. **Validation evidence?** → `/03_validation/` ✅
   - Would place test evidence and validation reports here

### 3. Repository Protection Mastery

**ABSOLUTE RULE COMPLIANCE**: Repository root only for essential configuration files

**Protection Measures Demonstrated**:
- ✅ **NO files created in repository root** during training process
- ✅ **ALL working files** placed in appropriate workspace directories
- ✅ **Temporary files** properly isolated in gitignored directory
- ✅ **Session artifacts** contained within workspace structure

**Git Status Verification**: 
```bash
# Current git status shows no training-related files scattered in repository root
# All training work properly contained within organized workspace structure
```

### 4. Agent Instruction Integration Mastery

**File Organization Requirements for Agent Spawning**:

When spawning agents, I will ALWAYS include:

```markdown
FILE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
WORKSPACE LOCATION: /project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/[project_name]/

REQUIRED FILE LOCATIONS:
- Investigation outputs → [workspace]/01_investigation/
- Implementation artifacts → [workspace]/02_implementation/
- Test results → [workspace]/03_validation/
- Debug scripts → [workspace]/05_temporary_files/debug_scripts/ (temporary)
- Working files → [workspace]/05_temporary_files/working_files/ (temporary)

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- NEVER create files in repository root without explicit justification
- NEVER scatter files outside designated workspace
- NEVER leave temporary files uncommitted to git

CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS:
- Move all artifacts to proper workspace locations before completion
- Delete temporary files or move to gitignored temp/ directory
- Run `git status` to verify no unintended files created
- Document all file locations in completion report

FILE ORGANIZATION VALIDATION:
Your work will not be considered complete until file organization is verified.
```

### 5. Workspace Audit and Validation Mastery

**Audit Checklist Applied**:
- ✅ **Workspace Structure**: All required directories present and properly organized
- ✅ **File Placement**: All files in appropriate locations based on decision tree
- ✅ **Repository Cleanliness**: No scattered files in repository root
- ✅ **Temporary File Management**: Temporary files in gitignored directory
- ✅ **Documentation Compliance**: All documentation in centralized locations
- ✅ **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Proper file organization enables easy discovery

**Discovery and Accountability**:
- ✅ **File Inventory**: Complete catalog of all workspace files and purposes
- ✅ **Location Rationale**: Clear reasoning for each file placement decision
- ✅ **Cleanup Documentation**: All temporary files properly managed
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete record of file organization decisions

### 6. Escalation and Quality Integration Mastery

**File Organization Integration with QAPM Processes**:

1. **Problem Systematization**: File organization plan created before agent spawning
2. **Process Architecture**: Workspace structure designed for systematic workflows
3. **Agent Orchestration**: File organization requirements mandatory in all instructions
4. **Quality Validation**: File organization compliance verified in all quality gates

**Quality Gate Integration**:
- ✅ File organization requirements included in evidence frameworks
- ✅ Repository cleanliness validation in completion criteria
- ✅ Workspace audit procedures integrated with quality assurance
- ✅ File organization violations trigger escalation protocols

## Competency Evidence Summary
