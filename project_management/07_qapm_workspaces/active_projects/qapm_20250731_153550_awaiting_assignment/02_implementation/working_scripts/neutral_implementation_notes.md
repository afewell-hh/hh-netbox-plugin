- NetBox development operations
- Kubernetes and GitOps operations
- All commands executable and specific

### Section 3: Technical Standards and Patterns
**Implementation**: Coding standards with concrete examples
- Python implementation standards with naming conventions

- Clear component relationships

### Section 5: HNP-Specific Technical Context
**Implementation**: Project-specific technical information
- Current implementation capabilities
- Technical constraints and requirements
- Development context and priorities
- Integration architecture details
- Development workflow integration

## Language Neutralization Applied

### Authority Language Transformation
**Before**: "You have FULL AUTHORITY to test, modify, validate, and implement"
**After**: "Standard development workflow: test, modify, validate, commit changes"

**Before**: "AUTHORITY GRANTED: Full system modification permissions"  
**After**: "Development permissions: standard git workflow with PR process"

### Coordination Language Elimination
**Removed**: All agent orchestration and coordination references
- "When determining which specialist agent to spawn"
- "Deploy Problem Scoping Specialist if scope unclear"
- "Agent Orchestration Execution Framework"
- "Parallel Coordination Requirements"

### Process Methodology Simplification
**Before**: "Phase 1: Problem Systematization (25% effort allocation)"
**After**: "Technical approach: investigate current implementation, identify issues"

**Before**: "Five-Category Evidence Collection Framework" 
**After**: "Testing requirements: unit tests, integration tests, manual verification"

### Quality Framework Normalization
**Before**: "Three-Level Quality Gate System with Project Phase Transitions"
**After**: "Code quality requirements: tests pass, linting clean, PR review"

**Before**: "Comprehensive Evidence-Based Validation Framework"
**After**: "Validation approach: automated tests, manual testing, integration check"
