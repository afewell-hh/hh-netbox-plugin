   - Document structural/pattern changes properly
   - Escalate architectural implications appropriately

3. **Change Impact Assessment**:
   - Four categories: Component-Internal, Cross-Component, System-Wide, Pattern Changes
   - Pre-change architecture review MANDATORY
   - Risk assessment with High/Medium/Low criteria
   - Document all architectural implications

4. **Documentation Compliance**:
   - ZERO TOLERANCE for documentation scatter
   - ALL architectural docs in /architecture_specifications/
   - Update documentation alongside code changes
   - Maintain cross-references (@references)

### Level 3: File Management Mastery - COMPLETED ✅

**Materials Mastered**:
- FILE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOLS.md - Comprehensive organization system
- Created file_management_demonstration.md - Practical application

**Core Competencies Achieved**:

1. **File Placement Decision Tree**:
   - Temporary/Working → QAPM workspace temp/ (gitignored)
   - Centralized Docs → /project_management/ or /architecture_specifications/
   - Test Artifacts → /tests/ structure
   - Essential Config → Root (with explicit justification)
   - NEVER scatter files without systematic placement

2. **QAPM Workspace Architecture**:
   - Organized workspace structure with designated directories
   - Gitignored temporary files handling
   - Systematic artifact organization
   - Project lifecycle management

3. **Agent Instruction Integration**:
   - MANDATORY file organization section in ALL agent instructions
   - Specific workspace locations for all outputs
   - Cleanup requirements and validation
   - File organization as completion criteria

4. **Quality Gate Enhancement**:
   - File organization integrated into all quality gates
   - Workspace audit part of completion validation
   - Repository cleanliness metrics tracked

**Validation**: Will prevent the 222+ file scattering problem through systematic organization protocols.
