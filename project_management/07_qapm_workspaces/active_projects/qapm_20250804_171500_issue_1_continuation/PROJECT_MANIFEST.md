**Agent ID**: qapm_20250804_171500_issue_1_continuation  
**Project Type**: Dual Mission - Enhanced Training + GitHub Issue Continuation  
**Priority**: HIGH - Training foundation + Critical issue continuation  
**Status**: Ready for dual mission initialization

## Mission Statement

**Dual Mission**: 
1. **Phase 1**: Complete comprehensive Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training including Memory-Aware Coordination, Adaptive Failure Recovery, and GitHub Integration Mastery
2. **Phase 2**: Review GitHub Issue #1, analyze previous agent's notes and multi-step implementation plan, then continue the work using enhanced methodology

**Success Definition**: Demonstrate full Enhanced QAPM v2.5 competency, then successfully continue previous agent's Issue #1 implementation using enhanced capabilities to prevent false completion syndrome and memory-induced failures.
