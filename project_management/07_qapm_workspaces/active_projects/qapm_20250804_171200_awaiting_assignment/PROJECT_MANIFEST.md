## Mission Statement

**Primary Mission**: Complete comprehensive Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training including Memory-Aware Coordination, Adaptive Failure Recovery, and GitHub Integration Mastery, then report readiness for project assignment.

**Success Definition**: Demonstrate full competency in Enhanced QAPM v2.5 methodology capable of preventing false completion syndrome and memory-induced failures while enabling persistent multi-session project coordination.

## Training Context

**Enhanced Methodology Available**: Complete Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training system (131,000+ words) including revolutionary enhancements addressing critical issues:
