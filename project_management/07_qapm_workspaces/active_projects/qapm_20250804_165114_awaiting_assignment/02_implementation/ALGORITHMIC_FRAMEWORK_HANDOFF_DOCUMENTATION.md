## ALGORITHM 1: MEMORY-AWARE TASK ASSESSMENT (1-5 COMPLEXITY SCALE)

### Core Algorithm Purpose
**Problem Solved**: 100% false completion rate due to task complexity exceeding agent memory capacity  
**Solution Approach**: Mathematical assessment of task complexity vs agent memory capacity with automated decomposition recommendations

### Key Algorithmic Components

#### 1.1 Task Complexity Assessment Algorithm
```markdown
COMPLEXITY_SCORE = Initial_Information_Density + Cognitive_Load + Memory_Persistence_Requirements

Complexity Scale Assignment:
- 1 (Simple): ≤2.0 weighted score, single focus, <2 hours
- 2 (Moderate): 2.1-4.0 score, 2-3 focus areas, 2-4 hours  
- 3 (Complex): 4.1-6.0 score, multiple focus areas, 4-8 hours
- 4 (Very Complex): 6.1-8.0 score, many focus areas, 8-16 hours
- 5 (Extremely Complex): >8.0 score, overwhelming complexity, >16 hours
```

#### 1.2 Agent Memory Capacity Assessment Algorithm
```markdown
FINAL_AGENT_CAPACITY = Base_Memory_Capacity - Current_Context_Load + External_Memory_Support

Agent Type Memory Baselines:
- Coordinator: 3, Analyst: 4, Architect: 4, Researcher: 3
- Optimizer: 2, Coder: 2, Tester: 2, Specialist: 3, Monitor: 2
```

#### 1.3 Decision Algorithm with Success Probability
```markdown
IF Task_Complexity ≤ Agent_Capacity: PROCEED_DIRECT (Success: 90%+)
IF Task_Complexity ≤ Agent_Capacity + 1: EXTERNAL_MEMORY_SUPPORT (Success: 70%+)  
IF Task_Complexity ≤ Agent_Capacity + 2: DECOMPOSITION_REQUIRED (Success: 40%+)
ELSE: IMPOSSIBLE_FOR_SINGLE_AGENT (Success: <10%)
```

**Solution Approach**: File-based context handoffs with overhead monitoring and automatic simplification

### Key Algorithmic Components

#### 3.1 Task Sequence Planning and Agent Assignment
```markdown
AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_OPTIMIZATION:
Suitability_Score = Capability_Match + Context_Continuity + Specialization_Bonus - Memory_Load_Penalty

Optimal Assignment: Maximize suitability while minimizing context transfers
```

#### 3.2 File-Based Context Management System
```markdown
CONTEXT_FILE_STRUCTURE:
/agent_context/{task_id}/
├── essential/task_context.md (core information)
├── outputs/previous_results/ (key artifacts)

```markdown
OVERHEAD_LIMITS:
- Individual Task: <20% coordination overhead
- Cumulative Project: <15% coordination overhead
- Context Preparation: <10% of task time
- Validation: <10% of task time

AUTOMATIC_FALLBACK: Switch to simplified coordination when limits exceeded
```
