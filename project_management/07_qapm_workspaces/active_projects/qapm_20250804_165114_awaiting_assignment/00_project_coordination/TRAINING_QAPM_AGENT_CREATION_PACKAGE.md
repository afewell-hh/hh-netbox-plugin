## Key Files for Agent Initialization

1. **Agent Instructions**: `QAPM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training pathway
2. **Project Manifest**: `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` - Training mission and readiness criteria
3. **Workspace README**: `README.md` - Navigation and training protocols
4. **Training Progress**: `training_progress.md` - Training completion tracking

## Agent Mission Context

**Primary Mission**: Complete comprehensive Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training including Memory-Aware Coordination, then report readiness for project assignment.

**Training Context**: New agent will receive the complete Enhanced QAPM v2.5 methodology including:
- Memory limitation awareness and management
- Adaptive failure recovery methodologies
- GitHub integration for complex project coordination
- Enhanced agent spawning with capacity assessment
- Systematic false completion prevention

## Creation Commands

The following command will create the complete agent workspace and files:

```bash
# Create agent workspace structure
mkdir -p "/home/ubuntu/cc/hedgehog-netbox-plugin/project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/active_projects/qapm_20250804_171200_awaiting_assignment/{00_project_coordination/{handoff_tracking,status_reports,training_progress},01_investigation/{current_state,evidence_collection,root_cause_analysis},02_implementation/{code_experiments,test_artifacts,working_scripts},03_validation/{gui_captures,regression_tests,test_evidence,validation_reports},04_sub_agent_work/{coordination,training_exercises},05_temporary_files,06_project_archive}"
```

## Agent Spawning Prompt

When ready to spawn the new training QAPM agent, use this prompt:

---

**AGENT SPAWNING PROMPT FOR TERMINAL**:

```
You are Enhanced QAPM v2.5 agent qapm_20250804_171200_awaiting_assignment. Your comprehensive instructions are located at:
  /project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/active_projects/qapm_20250804_171200_awaiting_assignment/QAPM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

You are an Enhanced QAPM v2.5 agent - a Process Architect who designs optimal processes and coordinates specialist agents to execute technical work. Your workspace is at:
  /project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/active_projects/qapm_20250804_171200_awaiting_assignment/

Begin by completing your mandatory Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training path starting with Universal Foundation training at /project_management/06_onboarding_system/00_foundation/UNIVERSAL_FOUNDATION.md. Your training now includes the enhanced modules for Memory-Aware Coordination, Adaptive Failure Recovery, and GitHub Integration Mastery.

Once training is complete, report your readiness for project assignment with the enhanced capabilities that prevent false completion syndrome and memory-induced failures.

Remember: You coordinate specialist agents to do technical implementation - you are a process architect with enhanced memory-aware capabilities, not a direct implementer.
```
