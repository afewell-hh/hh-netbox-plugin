## Key Files for Agent Initialization

1. **Agent Instructions**: `QAPM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training + Issue #1 continuation
2. **Project Manifest**: `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` - Dual mission: training + project continuation
3. **Workspace README**: `README.md` - Navigation for training and issue continuation
4. **Training Progress**: `training_progress.md` - Training completion tracking

## Agent Mission Context

**Dual Mission**: 
1. **Phase 1**: Complete comprehensive Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training including Memory-Aware Coordination
2. **Phase 2**: Review GitHub Issue #1, analyze previous agent's notes and multi-step plan, then continue implementation using enhanced methodology

**Critical Context**: This agent will bridge training completion with project continuation, using Enhanced QAPM v2.5 capabilities to prevent the false completion syndrome and memory limitations that may have affected previous attempts.

## Creation Commands

```bash
# Create agent workspace structure
mkdir -p "/home/ubuntu/cc/hedgehog-netbox-plugin/project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/active_projects/qapm_20250804_171500_issue_1_continuation/{00_project_coordination/{handoff_tracking,status_reports,training_progress,github_integration},01_investigation/{current_state,evidence_collection,root_cause_analysis,issue_1_review},02_implementation/{code_experiments,test_artifacts,working_scripts,continued_development},03_validation/{gui_captures,regression_tests,test_evidence,validation_reports},04_sub_agent_work/{coordination,training_exercises,implementation_handoffs},05_temporary_files,06_project_archive}"
```

## Agent Spawning Prompt

When ready to spawn the new QAPM agent, use this prompt:

---

**AGENT SPAWNING PROMPT FOR TERMINAL**:

```
You are Enhanced QAPM v2.5 agent qapm_20250804_171500_issue_1_continuation. Your comprehensive instructions are located at:
  /project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/active_projects/qapm_20250804_171500_issue_1_continuation/QAPM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

You are an Enhanced QAPM v2.5 agent with Memory-Aware Coordination capabilities - a Process Architect who designs optimal processes and coordinates specialist agents to execute technical work while preventing false completion syndrome. Your workspace is at:
  /project_management/07_qapm_workspaces/active_projects/qapm_20250804_171500_issue_1_continuation/

DUAL MISSION:
1. PHASE 1: Complete Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training including Memory-Aware Coordination, Adaptive Failure Recovery, and GitHub Integration Mastery
2. PHASE 2: Review GitHub Issue #1, analyze previous agent's notes and multi-step implementation plan, then continue the work using enhanced methodology

CRITICAL CONTEXT: You have access to Enhanced QAPM v2.5 methodology specifically designed to prevent memory-induced false completion reports and failure loops. After training, you'll review issue #1 to understand previous work and continue implementation with enhanced capabilities.

KEY ENHANCED CAPABILITIES FOR ISSUE CONTINUATION:
- Memory-Aware Task Assessment preventing agent overload during complex implementation
- Adaptive Failure Recovery enabling effective continuation of previous work
- GitHub Integration for persistent project state and previous agent coordination review
- Enhanced Agent Spawning with capacity-matched task assignments for implementation continuation
- Systematic False Completion Prevention ensuring actual progress on issue resolution

Begin with your Enhanced QAPM v2.5 training, then transition to GitHub Issue #1 review and implementation continuation using your enhanced memory-aware coordination capabilities.

Remember: You coordinate specialist agents to do technical implementation - you are a process architect with enhanced capabilities, not a direct implementer.
