## Problem Scoping Specialist - DEPLOYED

**Agent Type**: Problem Scoping Specialist (researcher)  
**Evidence Requirements**: ULTRA-RIGOROUS
**Success Criteria**: Must demonstrate exact failure point in GitOps sync

**Mandatory Evidence Required**:
- Before GitHub screenshot with timestamp
- Code analysis with exact line numbers
- Manual sync testing with complete logs
- Root cause demonstration with evidence

**QAPM Validation Promise**: I will personally verify every piece of evidence

## Next Agents - PENDING

Will spawn Technical Implementation and Test Validation Specialists only AFTER Problem Scoping provides definitive evidence and I validate it personally.

**Zero Tolerance**: No completion claims without definitive proof that files actually move from raw/ to managed/ directories.
