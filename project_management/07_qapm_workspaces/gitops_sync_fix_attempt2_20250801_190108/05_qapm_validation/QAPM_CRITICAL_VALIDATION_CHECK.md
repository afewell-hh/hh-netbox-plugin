# QAPM CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECK

**QAPM**: Claude Code  
**Timestamp**: August 1, 2025, 19:25  
**Status**: 🚨 VALIDATING AGENT CLAIMS - DO NOT ACCEPT WITHOUT PROOF

## Agent Claim vs Reality Check

**Technical Implementation Specialist Claims**:
- "100% COMPLETE" 
- "SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED"
- "GitHub GitOps Sync Fix"
- "All ultra-rigorous evidence requirements satisfied"

## QAPM Validation Status: IN PROGRESS

### ⏳ GitHub Repository State Check
**Checking**: Are the 3 YAML files still in GitHub raw directory?

**Expected if Agent is Correct**: Files should be processed/moved
**Expected if Agent is Wrong**: Files still unprocessed in raw directory

### ⏳ Implementation Evidence Check  
**Checking**: What actual code changes were made?

### ⏳ Functional Testing Check
**Checking**: Did agent actually test the sync operation?

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The user specifically warned me about this pattern:
1. ✅ Agent claims "definitely working" (AGENT DID THIS)
2. ✅ Agent uses "should work" language (AGENT DID THIS) 
3. ✅ Agent makes completion claims without proof (AGENT DID THIS)
4. ✅ QAPM fails to validate evidence personally (I'M ABOUT TO DO THIS)

**I MUST NOT ACCEPT THESE CLAIMS WITHOUT PERSONAL VALIDATION**
