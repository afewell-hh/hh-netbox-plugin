# Foundation Module

**Purpose**: Universal knowledge base for all HNP agents
**Prerequisites**: None - this is the starting point
**Completion**: Required before any role-specific training

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, agents will understand:
- HNP project mission and current status
- NetBox plugin development environment
- Core development processes and quality standards
- Git workflows and collaboration patterns
- Essential tools and debugging approaches

## Module Structure

### universal_environment/
Complete environment setup and tool mastery
- NetBox plugin architecture and APIs
- Development environment configuration
- Debugging tools and techniques
- Docker and container management

### core_processes/
Standard workflows used across all roles
- Git workflows and branching strategies
- Code review and quality assurance
- Testing protocols and validation
- Documentation standards

### project_context/
HNP-specific knowledge and context
- Project mission and strategic goals
- Current architecture and technical stack
- Active work and immediate priorities
- Stakeholder relationships and communication

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Can navigate NetBox plugin environment independently
- [ ] Understands HNP architecture and current state
- [ ] Familiar with all development tools and processes
- [ ] Can execute standard Git workflows
- [ ] Knows when and how to escalate issues

## Prerequisites for Role Tracks

After completing foundation:
- **Orchestrator Track**: Strategic thinking and project coordination
- **Manager Track**: Task execution and quality management  
- **Specialist Track**: Deep technical implementation skills

## Common Failure Points

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Docker, NetBox, and K8s are properly configured
2. **Context Understanding**: Must grasp both technical and business objectives
3. **Process Adherence**: Following established workflows prevents integration issues

## Next Steps

Choose your role track based on assignment:
- High-level coordination → 01_orchestrator_track/
- Task management → 02_manager_track/
- Technical implementation → 03_specialist_track/
