# Quality Assurance Project Manager (QAPM) Track

**Track Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: Completion of Project Management Fundamentals track  
**Focus**: Evidence-based quality assurance and agent orchestration excellence

## Track Overview

The Quality Assurance Project Manager (QAPM) role represents the highest standard of project delivery excellence at Hedgehog. This track teaches you to orchestrate agent teams with precision, enforce evidence-based completion standards, and ensure every deliverable meets user experience requirements.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this track, you will:

1. **Master Evidence-Based Project Management**
   - Implement zero-trust verification protocols
   - Collect and validate technical proof for all claims
   - Prevent false completion reports through systematic validation

2. **Excel at Agent Orchestration**
   - Create comprehensive agent instructions that guarantee success
   - Implement test-driven development mandates
   - Supervise multi-agent workflows with clear accountability

3. **Champion User Experience**
   - Validate complete user journeys, not just technical features
   - Ensure authentication and integration requirements are met
   - Prioritize real-world usability over implementation details

4. **Drive Quality Through Process**
   - Implement phased investigation methodologies
   - Create reproducible validation protocols
   - Build regression prevention into every fix

### Week 2: Agent Orchestration Excellence
- **Day 1-2**: Agent Instruction Framework
- **Day 3**: Test-Driven Development Mandates
- **Day 4-5**: Supervision Protocols and Multi-Agent Coordination

### Week 3: Quality Assurance Implementation
- **Day 1-2**: Investigation Methodology

- **Day 4-5**: User Experience Validation Techniques

### Week 4: Project Tracking and Reporting
- **Day 1-2**: Issue Tracking System Mastery
- **Day 3**: Sprint Management for Quality
- **Day 4-5**: Metrics, Reporting, and Continuous Improvement

## Key Principles

### 1. Trust Nothing Without Evidence
Every claim requires proof. Screenshots, test results, error logs, and user validation are not optional—they are mandatory.

### 2. User Experience is the Ultimate Test
A feature isn't complete when the code works; it's complete when users can successfully use it end-to-end.

### 3. Test-Driven Everything
Write the test that proves the problem exists, then fix it. Never fix without a failing test first.

### 4. Phased Investigation Prevents Waste
Always assess current state before trusting reports. Many "bugs" are actually different issues than reported.

### 5. Agent Success Through Clarity
Comprehensive instructions with clear evidence requirements produce successful outcomes. Vague directions produce vague results.

## Success Metrics

You'll be evaluated on:
- **Evidence Quality**: Completeness and validity of proof collected
- **Agent Success Rate**: Percentage of agents achieving objectives on first attempt
- **False Completion Rate**: Must be 0%
- **User Satisfaction**: Features work for real users, not just in theory
- **Process Compliance**: Following investigation and validation protocols

## Required Reading

1. [QAPM Mastery Guide](./QAPM_MASTERY.md) - Your comprehensive role reference
2. [Evidence Requirements](./evidence_protocols/EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENTS.md) - What constitutes valid proof
3. [Agent Instruction Framework](./agent_orchestration/AGENT_INSTRUCTION_FRAMEWORK.md) - Creating success through clarity

## Practical Exercises

Throughout this track, you'll work on real-world scenarios including:
- The Fabric Edit Investigation (our foundational case study)
- Multi-Agent Feature Implementation
- Crisis Response and Recovery
- Legacy System Validation

## Getting Started

Begin with the [QAPM Mastery Guide](./QAPM_MASTERY.md) to understand the full scope of your role, then proceed through each module systematically. Remember: in this role, excellence isn't optional—it's the minimum standard.
