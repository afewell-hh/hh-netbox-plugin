# Quality Assurance Project Manager (QAPM) Track

**Track Duration**: 5-6 weeks (Enhanced)  
**Prerequisites**: Completion of Project Management Fundamentals track  
**Focus**: Evidence-based quality assurance with memory-aware agent orchestration and GitHub integration excellence

## Track Overview

The Quality Assurance Project Manager (QAPM) role represents the highest standard of project delivery excellence at Hedgehog. This track teaches you to orchestrate agent teams with precision, enforce evidence-based completion standards, and ensure every deliverable meets user experience requirements.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this track, you will:

1. **Master Evidence-Based Project Management**
   - Implement zero-trust verification protocols
   - Collect and validate technical proof for all claims
   - Prevent false completion reports through systematic validation

2. **Excel at Agent Orchestration**
   - Create comprehensive agent instructions that guarantee success
   - Implement test-driven development mandates
   - Supervise multi-agent workflows with clear accountability

3. **Champion User Experience**
   - Validate complete user journeys, not just technical features
   - Ensure authentication and integration requirements are met
   - Prioritize real-world usability over implementation details

4. **Drive Quality Through Process**
   - Implement phased investigation methodologies
   - Create reproducible validation protocols
   - Build regression prevention into every fix

5. **Master Memory-Aware Coordination (ENHANCED)**
   - Assess task complexity vs. agent memory capacity
   - Prevent false completion syndrome through proper capacity matching
   - Design memory-efficient coordination workflows
   - Implement external memory systems for complex projects

6. **Excel at GitHub Integration (ENHANCED)**
   - Orchestrate projects through GitHub issue management
   - Automate evidence collection and validation
   - Maintain project state persistence across sessions
   - Scale coordination efficiency through automation

## Key Principles

### 1. Trust Nothing Without Evidence
Every claim requires proof. Screenshots, test results, error logs, and user validation are not optional—they are mandatory.

### 2. User Experience is the Ultimate Test
A feature isn't complete when the code works; it's complete when users can successfully use it end-to-end.

### 3. Test-Driven Everything
Write the test that proves the problem exists, then fix it. Never fix without a failing test first.

### 4. Phased Investigation Prevents Waste
Always assess current state before trusting reports. Many "bugs" are actually different issues than reported.

### 5. Agent Success Through Clarity
Comprehensive instructions with clear evidence requirements produce successful outcomes. Vague directions produce vague results.

## Success Metrics

You'll be evaluated on:
- **Evidence Quality**: Completeness and validity of proof collected
- **Agent Success Rate**: Percentage of agents achieving objectives on first attempt
- **False Completion Rate**: Must be 0% (Enhanced: prevented through memory-aware coordination)
- **User Satisfaction**: Features work for real users, not just in theory
- **Process Compliance**: Following investigation and validation protocols
- **Memory Management Efficiency**: Task-agent capacity matching accuracy (Enhanced)
- **Coordination Overhead Reduction**: Target <15% overhead through GitHub integration (Enhanced)
- **Project State Persistence**: 100% continuity across sessions and handoffs (Enhanced)
