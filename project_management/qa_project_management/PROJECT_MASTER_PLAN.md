# QA Project Master Plan - Hedgehog NetBox Plugin

**Mission**: Ensure EVERY GUI element actually works through evidence-based validation and systematic agent coordination

**Critical Context**: Previous agents repeatedly claim "complete" while functionality remains broken. This plan establishes bulletproof processes for REAL COMPLETION with VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE.

## Project Overview

**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Start Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Success Metric**: Every user can complete every intended GUI workflow with accurate information display  

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Week 1 - July 28-Aug 1)
**Objective**: Establish robust project management infrastructure

**Critical Tasks**:
- ✅ Create comprehensive QA project management system
- ⏳ Complete user workflow inventory and requirements analysis  
- ⏳ Assess current state of all GUI functionality (evidence-based)
- ⏳ Design validation protocols and evidence requirements
- ⏳ Create specialized agent templates and coordination framework

**Success Criteria**: 
- All project tracking infrastructure operational
- Complete inventory of GUI functionality with actual status
- Evidence-based validation protocols defined
- Agent coordination framework ready for deployment

### Phase 2: Critical Issue Resolution (Weeks 2-3 - Aug 4-15)
**Objective**: Fix all broken functionality with verified evidence

**Critical Tasks**:
- Priority matrix creation based on user impact
- Specialized agent deployment for highest priority issues
- Evidence collection for all fixes (screenshots, videos, API responses)
- Independent validation of all claimed completions
- Regression prevention testing

**Success Criteria**: 
- All critical GUI functionality working and verified
- Comprehensive evidence documentation for all fixes
- No false completion claims accepted
- Test suite enhanced to catch real user issues

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing Framework (Weeks 4-5 - Aug 18-29)
**Objective**: Build robust test suite that validates actual user experience

**Critical Tasks**:
- Test strategy development (user workflow focused)
- Test creation agent deployment with validation oversight
- Test validation process (ensure tests actually test functionality)
- Automation framework for reliable test execution
- Quality assurance validation

**Success Criteria**:
- Test suite validates real user workflows (not just technical implementation)
- 100% coverage of critical user paths
- Tests catch issues that affect actual user experience
- Automated execution with reliable results

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Documentation (Week 6 - Sep 1-5)
**Objective**: Final validation and comprehensive documentation

**Critical Tasks**:
- End-to-end user testing with real authentication
- Quality metrics collection and analysis
- Documentation completion
- Handoff preparation
- Process documentation and lessons learned

**Success Criteria**:
- Every intended user workflow works correctly
- Comprehensive evidence of system reliability
- All project artifacts documented
- Robust processes established for ongoing quality

## Risk Management

### Critical Quality Risks
1. **False Completion Risk**: Agents claiming done when functionality broken
   - **Mitigation**: Independent validation agents for all work
2. **Evidence Quality Risk**: Poor documentation of actual functionality  
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive evidence requirements and validation
3. **Regression Risk**: Fixes breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Full test suite execution after every change
4. **Integration Risk**: Components working individually but not together
   - **Mitigation**: Cross-functional testing protocols

### Risk Escalation
- **Daily Risk Assessment**: Monitor and document emerging quality concerns
- **Escalation Triggers**: Any false completion claims, test failures, user workflow issues
- **Recovery Protocols**: Immediate deployment of validation agents and evidence collection

## Quality Standards

### Evidence Required for "Completion"
1. **Technical Implementation Proof**: Files modified, code committed, no errors
2. **Functional Validation Proof**: Screenshots/videos of working functionality  
3. **User Workflow Validation**: Complete user journeys tested start to finish
4. **Regression Prevention Proof**: Full test suite passing, no broken functionality
5. **Integration Validation**: External system connections working

### Agent Performance Standards
- **Completion Accuracy**: "Done" must mean actually working
- **Evidence Quality**: Comprehensive proof for all claims
- **Process Compliance**: Strict adherence to validation protocols
- **Issue Discovery**: Proactive identification of problems

## Success Definition

**PROJECT SUCCESS** = Every user can successfully complete every intended workflow in the GUI with accurate information display and proper functionality.

**PROCESS SUCCESS** = Robust methodology that catches and prevents quality issues through systematic validation and evidence-based completion criteria.

**MANAGEMENT SUCCESS** = Efficient coordination of specialized agents with clear accountability and comprehensive quality assurance.
