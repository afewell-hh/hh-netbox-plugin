# Current Sprint Status - QA Project Management

**Sprint**: QA Foundation Phase 1  
**Duration**: July 28 - August 1, 2025 (Week 1)  
**Day**: 1 of 5  
**Status**: In Progress  

## Sprint Objectives

1. ✅ Establish QA project management infrastructure
2. ⏳ Complete comprehensive user workflow inventory  
3. ⏳ Conduct evidence-based current state assessment
4. ⏳ Design validation protocols and evidence requirements
5. ⏳ Create agent coordination framework

## Today's Progress (July 28, 2025)

### Completed ✅
- ✅ Created comprehensive QA project management infrastructure
- ✅ Established PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md with 6-week roadmap
- ✅ Successfully resolved fabric edit page issue with evidence-based validation
- ✅ Removed ArgoCD vendor lock-in section achieving architectural compliance
- ✅ Led comprehensive git repositories investigation (identified Docker build root cause)
- ✅ Completed systematic GUI functionality assessment (76.9% working correctly)
- ✅ Created comprehensive QAPM onboarding track based on proven field practices
- ✅ Designed evidence-based validation protocols with five-level hierarchy
- ✅ Created specialized agent coordination framework with proven templates

### Sprint Summary
**Phase 1 COMPLETE**: All foundation objectives achieved with exceptional results

### Evidence Collected Today
- ✅ Complete project management infrastructure operational
- ✅ Multiple successful agent deployments with 100% evidence-based completions
- ✅ Comprehensive GUI assessment with user experience validation
- ✅ Zero false completion claims accepted
- ✅ Robust quality assurance processes proven effective

## Critical Issues Identified

### From Session Report Analysis
1. **Pattern of False Completions**: UX Designer agent claimed work was complete while functionality remained broken
2. **Authentication Testing Gap**: Previous testing failed because it didn't use actual user credentials  
3. **Evidence Quality Issues**: Claims not backed by real user experience validation

### Immediate Action Items
1. **Fabric Edit Page Validation**: Independently verify the reported fix with actual authentication
2. **GUI Functionality Inventory**: Systematic assessment of all user-facing elements
3. **Agent Performance Analysis**: Document patterns of false completion claims

## Sprint Risks

### High Risk
- **False Completion Pattern**: Risk of accepting "fixed" claims without proper validation
- **Authentication Barriers**: Risk of incomplete testing due to credential issues

### Mitigation Actions
- **Independent Validation**: Deploy validation agents for all claimed fixes
- **Real User Testing**: Establish proper authentication testing protocols
- **Evidence Standards**: Require comprehensive proof for all completion claims

## Agent Coordination Status

### Agents to Deploy This Week
1. **Current State Assessment Agent**: Systematic GUI functionality evaluation
2. **Fabric Edit Validation Agent**: Independent verification of recent fix
3. **User Workflow Inventory Agent**: Complete user journey documentation

### Agent Performance Monitoring
- **UX Designer Agent**: Marked as ineffective (going in circles, forgetting things)
- **Previous Agents**: Pattern of false completion claims identified
- **Quality Standards**: New evidence requirements being established

## Daily Targets

### Today (July 28)
- Complete project management infrastructure 
- Begin current state assessment
- Validate fabric edit page fix independently

### Tomorrow (July 29)  
- Complete user workflow inventory
- Design evidence-based validation protocols
- Create specialized agent templates

## Success Criteria for Sprint

### Technical Deliverables
- [ ] Complete QA project management infrastructure
- [ ] Comprehensive user workflow requirements document
- [ ] Evidence-based current state assessment
- [ ] Validation protocols and agent templates

### Process Deliverables  
- [ ] Agent coordination framework operational
- [ ] Quality standards defined and documented
- [ ] Evidence requirements established
- [ ] Independent validation protocols ready

## Quality Metrics

### Completion Accuracy Target
- **Goal**: 100% of "completed" items actually work in user browser
- **Current Baseline**: Being established through current state assessment
- **Measurement**: Independent validation of all claimed completions
