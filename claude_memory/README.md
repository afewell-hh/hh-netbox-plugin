# Claude Memory - External Memory System

**Purpose**: Persistent external memory for agents to maintain context across sessions and prevent repeated environment discovery.

## Directory Structure

### 🌍 environment/
**Development environment documentation** - Eliminate setup discovery cycles
- `netbox_docker_ops.md` - NetBox Docker operations and procedures
- `kubernetes_clusters.md` - HCKC and ArgoCD cluster information
- `gitops_infrastructure.md` - GitOps repository and workflow documentation
- `testing_environment.md` - Testing procedures and validation
- `local_development.md` - Local development setup guide

### 📋 project_context/
**Project background and context** - Understanding the mission
- `project_history.md` - Project evolution and major milestones
- `stakeholder_context.md` - User requirements and business context
- `technical_context.md` - Technical constraints and decisions
- `team_context.md` - Team structure and agent coordination
- `domain_knowledge.md` - Hedgehog and NetBox specific knowledge

### ⚙️ processes/
**Standard operating procedures** - How we work
- `git_workflow.md` - Git commit and branch management
- `documentation_standards.md` - Documentation creation and maintenance
- `quality_assurance.md` - Testing and validation procedures
- `agent_coordination.md` - Agent communication and coordination
- `deployment_process.md` - Release and deployment procedures
- `incident_response.md` - Issue handling and escalation

### 🚀 quick_reference/
**Immediate access information** - Quick answers
- `environment_checklist.md` - Quick environment setup validation
- `common_commands.md` - Frequently used commands and procedures
- `troubleshooting_quick.md` - Common issues and immediate solutions
- `escalation_contacts.md` - When and how to escalate issues
- `critical_paths.md` - Key file locations and navigation

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Agents should check here first** before rediscovering environment details
2. **Keep concise and factual** - This is reference material, not documentation
3. **Update when environment changes** - Keep information current
4. **Use for onboarding** - New agents start here

## Key Benefits

- **Eliminates Discovery Cycles**: Agents don't waste time rediscovering known information
- **Consistency**: All agents work with same environmental understanding
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to commonly needed information
- **Continuity**: Knowledge persists across agent sessions

## Maintenance

- **Environment changes**: Update immediately when infrastructure changes
- **Process updates**: Reflect new procedures as adopted
- **Quick reference**: Add new common issues as discovered
- **Regular review**: Monthly validation of accuracy
